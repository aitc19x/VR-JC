## Introduction

Recently, VR becomes a popular technology, which enables us to explore without going to real places by devices such as Google Cardboard. In order to prolong the friendship between Japan and China, the project was proposed.

The three organizations, Akashi Jyoken, AMSJXNU IT Club, and Crystal Nippon Bunka Kenkyu Group, are cooperated in order to convey a better experience to viewers.

This project uses Google VR, Google ARCore, and Unity C#. And i18n of this project contains Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean.

Welcome to use and contribute to our project along with GPL v3 license.

For the progress, please have a glance at the “Projects” tab.

## Environment

For Google ARCore support, you may need to install “XR Legacy Input Helpers” from “Package Manager”.

Suggested Unity version is 2019.3.2f1, and do not use 2020.1 or after because the update for GVR SDK for Unity is paused by Google.

Make sure to import [arcore-unity-sdk-1.15.0.unitypackage](https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-unity-sdk/releases/download/v1.15.0/arcore-unity-sdk-1.15.0.unitypackage) and [GoogleVRForUnity_1.200.1.unitypackage](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk/releases/download/v1.200.1/GoogleVRForUnity_1.200.1.unitypackage), and update all submodules before building.
